## Build and test

Please make sure Rust is [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

**Basic**

The following commands only build the Fe -> Yul compiler components.

- build the CLI: `cargo build`
- test: `cargo test --workspace`

**Full**

The Fe compiler depends on the Solidity compiler for transforming Yul IR to EVM bytecode. We currently use [solc-rust](https://github.com/g-r-a-n-t/solc-rust) to perform this. In order to compile solc-rust, the following must be installed on your system:

- cmake
- libboost
- libclang

Once these have been installed, you may run the full build. This is enabled using the *solc-backend* feature.

- build the CLI: `cargo build --features solc-backend`
- test: `cargo test --workspace --features solc-backend`
