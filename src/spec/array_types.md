An array is a fixed-size sequence of `N` elements of type `T`. The array type
is written as `Array<T, N>`. The size is an integer literal.

Arrays are either stored in storage or memory but are never stored directly on the stack.

Examples:

```Python
contract Foo:
  # An array in storage
  bar: Array<u8, 10>

  fn do_something():
    # An array in memory
    values: Array<u256, 3> = [10, 100, 100]
```

All elements of arrays are always initialized, and access to an array is
always bounds-checked in safe methods and operators.
