# `return` statement

The return statement is denoted with the keyword `return`. A `return` statement leaves the current function call with a return value which is either the value of the evaluated expression (if present) or `()` (unit type) if `return` is not followed by an expression explicitly.


An example of a `return` statement without explicit use of an expression:

```python
contract Foo:
    fn transfer(self, to: address, value: u256):
        if not self.in_whitelist(to):
            return

    fn in_whitelist(self, to: address) -> bool:
        # revert used as placeholder for actual logic
        revert
```

The above can also be written in a slightly more verbose form:

```python
contract Foo:
    fn transfer(self, to: address, value: u256) -> ():
        if not self.in_whitelist(to):
            return ()

    fn in_whitelist(self, to: address) -> bool:
        # revert used as placeholder for actual logic
        revert
```
