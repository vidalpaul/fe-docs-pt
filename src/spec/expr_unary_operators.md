The unary operators are used to negate expressions. The unary `-` (minus) operator yields the negation of its numeric argument. The unary `~` (invert) operator yields the *bitwise* inversion of its integer argument. The unary `not` operator yields the inversion of its boolean argument.

Example:

```
let x: bool = not true # false
let y: i256 = -1  # -1
let y: i256 = ~1  # -2
```
