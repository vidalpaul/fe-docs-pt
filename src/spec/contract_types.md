# Contract types

An *contract type* is the type denoted by the name of an [`contract` item].

A value of a given contract type carries the contract's public interface as 
attribute functions. A new contract value can be created by either casting
an address to a contract type or by creating a new contract using the type 
attribute functions `create` or `create2`.

Example:

```python 
contract Foo:
    pub fn get_my_num() -> u256:
        return 42

contract FooFactory:
    pub fn create2_foo() -> address:
        # `0` is the value being sent and `52` is the address salt
        let foo: Foo = Foo.create2(0, 52)
        return address(foo)
```
